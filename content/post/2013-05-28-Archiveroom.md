### Explore your GitHub archive data in 3D!

A short time ago I was made aware of a realy cool thing from a colleague. That was [http://archiveroom.net/](http://archiveroom.net/) the website. 
There you can create a graphical version of your git repository with just a few clicks, if it is hosted on Github.
There are all events that affect a repository as a block in a 3D world shown. Each event type is assigned a color and an icon. These are then displayed on the block. 
TThese blocks are stacked one above the other and next to each other. There is a three-dimensional image of the repository through which you you can navigate virtual.

This is a really cool thing and you can set up it with just a few clicks. If you want to try it, i can only recommend it. 
A guide with all necessairy steps can be find at the bottom of the [homepage](http://archiveroom.net/).
