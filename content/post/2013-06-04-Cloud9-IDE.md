[Cloud9](https://c9.io/) is an online development environment for writing, running and debugging Javascript, Node.js, PHP, Python, Java and Ruby applications. Itâ€™s often referred of as Google docs for code.
It's a really really cool tool with a very good Integration of github and bitbucket. So you can edit your repositorys online with a nice IDE. You can also debug your Projects so it's a good thing for editing your repositorys. 
Reasons to use [Cloud9](https://c9.io/):

* if you aren't at home or on a foreign computer
* if you haven't installed git
* if you won't to clone the repository (I think that isn't a reason)
* if you haven't installed a good IDE
