I'm a huge fan of the Chromecast, the small streaming dongle from google. And I already wrote about the
first version here: [Chromecast](/blog/2014/08/26/Chromecast/). There where always rumours 
that a Chromecast 2 is around the corner. And now it happened. They have finally presented one with features 
I'm waiting since I bought the first one. Mostly 5ghz WLAN, I don't understand why the first Chromecast 
was lacking this.

I use my Chromecast mostly for three apps: BeyondPod (which is the best podcast client on android), Plex (self hosted netflix) 
and YouTube (a platform for videos, you know that, right?). And these are the three apps I tested with the new Chromecast.
Nothing really surprising but all these apps are much smother to use, which is cool. Also nice was the on-boarding experience.


New is the [Chromcast Audio](http://www.google.com/chromecast/speakers/), which is at least for me not that exciting. But this is 
probably because I already have a Sonos sound system and I build something quite similar called [Radio Pi](http://radio-pi.github.io/).
But interesting is the price point it's much cheaper than Sonos and even cheaper than a self build solution with a Raspberry Pi. 


So if you have already a Chromecast there is no real reason to upgrade, but it's a nice to have. If you haven't one it's a good 
time to buy one.
