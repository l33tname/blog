I can confirm that [Crucial Ballistix Sport](http://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en/BLS2CP8G3D1609DS1S00CEU?IMODULE=BLS2CP8G3D1609DS1S00CEU) (part number: BLS2CP8G3D1609DS1S00CEU) 
running fine in the Dell T20. This mean I have now 20GB RAM \o/. Yeah you can mix ECC RAM with RAM that doesn't support ECC.


A extended review about the [Dell T20](http://l33tsource.com/blog/2014/07/16/Dell-T20-Review/), coming probably this week.


Note: This post is manly for people like me, who look first on google if someone running this successfully, since most time I don't want to buy certificate hardware.
