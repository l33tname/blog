Everytime I build websites I feel pain when I need to build a file upload. Because of they look terribly and different in each browser I build a small example of a fancy upload button.
 
![example](/blog-bilder/2013-07-21-Fancy-File-Upload-img1.jpg)
 
In this example you can see its [font awesome]( http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for the icons and [pure layout framework](http://purecss.io/). You can easily replace the icons and layout framework. In that case you're using JQuery it's not hard to implement it. It uses JavaScript which can be a problem for some people.
