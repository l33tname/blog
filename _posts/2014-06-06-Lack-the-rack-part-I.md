I got some 19 inch server. The problem I don't have a rack for it. So there are two options buy for a truck load of money a rack or build one on my own. So just buying a rack sounds boring, and I don't have a truck load of money. 

##First step

To build your own rack you need a table from [Ikea](http://www.ikea.com) called lack. They are available in different colours and cost around 5$ -15$.
They are exactly 19" and you can stack multiple of them to a large rack.

##Decoration

I invest some hours, to paint on the front site a logo.

##Assembly

The assembly of the table is so easy, that I think even a monkey can do it. 

##Mount the server

My servers are kind of short, so I need to attach them from the backside a bit.

And as you can see a 19" fit perfect in a lack table.
