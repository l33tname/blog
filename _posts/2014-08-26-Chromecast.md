I recently bought a [Chromecast](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/). And what should I say, I'm happy with it. 
The setup was easy as expected, you just plug in your HDMI and connect it with power. 

##How it looks

##The down site

When I bought it, there was only one or two apps I use frequently which support Chromecast. But since then there was a lot movement in this area.
A really nice is that google build the "Cast Screen" which allow you to stream you android screen to chromecast. This mean all apps work with chromecast. 

The game changer for me personaly was BeyondPod which is super awesome to stream video podcast. An other thing 
I do regulary is streaming my plex movies to Chromecast. 

##Summary
If you use regularly plex, BeyondPod or YouTube and you have a HDMI screen buy a Cromecast.
